# garden

A space for me to grow things on the web.

See it at [nathanshelly.dev](https://nathanshelly.dev) (or
[mostlydotfiles.dev](https://mostlydotfiles.dev)).

Currently composed of a blog (at [`/`](https://nathanshelly.dev/blog) or
[`/blog`](https://nathanshelly.dev/blog)) and an ongoing collection of
quarterly playlists filled with what I'm enjoying at the time
([`/fire`](https://nathanshelly.dev/fire) or
[`/ðŸ”¥`](https://nathanshelly.dev/ðŸ”¥)).
